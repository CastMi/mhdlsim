This repository is a copy of the Icarus Verilog repository available here:

https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog

The goal is to implement the interface for digital mixed simulation available here:

https://github.com/orsonmmz/mhdlsim/tree/proposed_changes

Design choice:

- The argumentParser is NOT compiler independent. Icarus Verilog and GHDL are the only solution considered for the moment.
